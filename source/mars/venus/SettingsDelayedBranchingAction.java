/**
 * Action class for the Settings menu item to control delayed branching. Note:
 * Changing this setting while the current program is runnable (assembled, or
 * stepped execution) or terminated triggers a re-assembly. This is necessary to
 * maintain consistency because the machine code assembled for branch
 * instructions differs depending on this setting -- would branch to incorrect
 * address if setting were changed between assembly and execution. Note: This
 * action is disabled while the MIPS program is running. The user need only
 * pause or stop execution to re-enable it.
