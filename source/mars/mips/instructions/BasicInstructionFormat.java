/**
 * These are the MIPS-defined formats of basic machine instructions. The
 * R-format indicates the instruction works only with registers. The I-format
 * indicates the instruction works with an immediate value (e.g. constant). The
 * J-format indicates this is a Jump instruction. The I-branch-format is defined
 * by me, not MIPS, to to indicate this is a Branch instruction, specifically to
 * distinguish immediate values used as target addresses.
