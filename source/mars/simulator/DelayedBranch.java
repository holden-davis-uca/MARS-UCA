/**
 * Represents a (potential) delayed branch. Note it is necessary only when
 * delayed branching is enabled. Here's the protocol for using it: (1) When a
 * runtime decision to branch is made (by either a branch or jump instruction's
 * simulate() method in InstructionSet), then if delayed branching is enabled,
 * the register() method is called with the branch target address but the
 * program counter is NOT set to the branch target address. (2) At the end of
 * that instruction cycle, the simulate() method in Simulator will detect the
 * registered branch, and set its trigger. Don't do anything yet because the
 * next instruction cycle is the delay slot and needs to complete. (3) At the
 * end of the next (delay slot) instruction cycle, the simulate() method in
 * Simulator will detect the triggered branch, set the program counter to its
 * target value and clear the delayed branch. The only interesting situation is
 * when the delay slot itself contains a successful branch! I tried this with
 * SPIM (e.g. beq followed by b) and it treats it as if nothing was there and
 * continues the delay slot into the next cycle. The eventual branch taken is
 * the original one (as one would hope) but in the meantime the first statement
 * following the sequence of successful branches will constitute the delay slot
 * and will be executed! Since only one pending delayed branch can be taken at a
 * time, everything here is done with statics. The class itself represents the
 * potential branch.
