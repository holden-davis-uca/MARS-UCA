				+ "A MARS Tool is a program listed in the MARS Tools menu.  It is launched "
				+ "when you select its menu item and typically interacts with executing MIPS "
				+ "programs to do something exciting and informative or at least interesting." + "\n\n"
				+ "A MARS Application is a stand-alone program for similarly interacting with "
				+ "executing MIPS programs.  It uses MARS' MIPS assembler and "
				+ "runtime simulator in the background to control MIPS execution." + "\n\n"
				+ "The basic requirements for building a MARS Tool are:" + "\n"
				+ "  1. It must be a class that implements the MarsTool interface.  "
				+ "This has only two methods: 'String getName()' to return the "
				+ "name to be displayed in its Tools menu item, and "
				+ "'void action()' which is invoked when that menu item " + "is selected by the MARS user." + "\n"
				+ "  2. It must be stored in the mars.tools package (in folder " + "mars/tools)" + "\n"
				+ "  3. It must be successfully compiled in that package.  This "
				+ "normally means the MARS distribution needs to be extracted from the "
				+ "JAR file before you can develop your Tool." + "\n\n"
				+ "If these requirements are met, MARS will recognize and load "
				+ "your Tool into its Tools menu the next time it runs." + "\n\n"
				+ "There are no fixed requirements for building a MARS Application, a "
				+ "stand-alone program that utilizes the MARS API." + "\n\n"
				+ "You can build a program that may be run as either a MARS Tool or an Application.  "
				+ "The easiest way is to extend an abstract class provided in the MARS distribution: "
				+ "mars.tools.AbstractMarsToolAndApplication.  " + "\n"
				+ "  1. It defines a suite of methods and provides default definitions for "
				+ "all but two: getName() and buildMainDisplayArea()." + "\n"
				+ "  2.  String getName() was introduced above." + "\n"
				+ "  3.  JComponent buildMainDisplayArea() returns the JComponent to be placed in the "
				+ "BorderLayout.CENTER region of the tool/app's user interface.  The NORTH and "
				+ "SOUTH are defined to contain a heading and a set of button controls, respectively.  " + "\n"
				+ "  4. It defines a default 'void go()' method to launch the application." + "\n"
				+ "  5. Conventional usage is to define your application as a subclass then launch it "
				+ "by invoking its go() method." + "\n\n"
				+ "The frame/dialog you are reading right now is an example of an "
				+ "AbstractMarsToolAndApplication subclass.  If you run it as an application, you "
				+ "will notice the set of controls at the bottom of the window differ from those "
				+ "you get when running it from MARS' Tools menu.  It includes additional controls "
				+ "to load and control the execution of pre-existing MIPS programs." + "\n\n"
				+ "See the mars.tools.AbstractMarsToolAndApplication API or the source code of "
				+ "existing tool/apps for further information." + "\n");
