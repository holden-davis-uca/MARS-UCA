# MARS-UCA

## About
Modification of the [MARS](https://courses.missouristate.edu/kenvollmar/mars/) program originally written by Kenneth Vollmar and Pete Sanderson at Missouri State University.
 * DISCLAIMER: *Any and all rights are reserved by the aforementioned entities. I do not own this program, nor am I involved in its development. These modifications are provided solely for the benefit of its users.*

This version of MARS is specifically modified for usage in CSCI 2340 - Assembly Language Programming, offered by the University of Central Arkansas.

## Usage

### Requirements
* To run: Java 17.0.2 or later
* To modify: Eclipse 2021-12 or later

This repository is structured as an Eclipse workspace. The "source" folder is structured as an Eclipse Java Project and contains all of the source files retrieved from decompiling the original JAR file.

* To use the program itself, download the "Mars-UCA.jar" file in the top-level directory. Double-click on the downloaded file to run MARS, or use "java -jar Mars-UCA.jar" if it doesn't start.

* To modify the source code, download the repository and open it as a workspace in Eclipse, or download the "source" folder and open it as a project in Eclipse. After making any changes, run the "CreateMarsJar.bat" script included in the "source" folder to create a runnable Mars-UCA.jar file.
